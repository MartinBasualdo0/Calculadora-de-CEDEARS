# CEDEAR Calculator

Welcome to the CEDEAR Calculator! This Dash app allows users to calculate the implicit exchange rate between US-listed tickers and Argentina-listed tickers (known as CEDEARs), along with the recommended price to buy them in the local market. It's designed to help users avoid purchasing at any price, especially considering the relatively low volume of operations in the Argentinian market.

## Features

- **Implicit Exchange Rate Calculation**: Users can input both US-listed tickers and Argentina-listed tickers to calculate the implicit exchange rate.
- **Recommended Buy Price**: The app provides users with the recommended price to buy CEDEARs in the local market, helping them make informed decisions.
- **Dynamic Plotting**: A dynamic plot allows users to compare different exchange rates across various CEDEARs.
- **Custom Ticker Addition**: Users can freely add Argentina-listed tickers to find the recommended buy price for them.

## How to Use

1. **Input Tickers**: Enter the US-listed ticker or Argentina-listed ticker (CEDEAR) in the provided input box.
2. **Add Ticker**: Click the "Add Ticker" button to include the entered ticker for analysis.
3. **View Results**: The app dynamically displays the recommended buy price and the calculated exchange rate.
4. **Explore Plot**: Check out the dynamic plot to compare exchange rates across different CEDEARs.

## Technologies Used

- **Dash**: The app is built using Dash, a productive Python framework for building web applications.
- **Pandas**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, facilitating data handling.
- **Plotly**: The dynamic plotting feature is powered by Plotly, enabling interactive and visually appealing visualizations.
